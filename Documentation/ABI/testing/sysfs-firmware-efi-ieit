Description:	Provides userland access to read the EFI Image Execution Info
		Table (IEIT), a log of images which were launched or attempted
		to be launched during boot.  The IEIT is described by (ESRT), a
		catalog of firmware for which can be updated with the UEFI
		UpdateCapsule mechanism described in section 7.5 of the UEFI
		Standard.

What:		/sys/firmware/efi/ieit/entry$N/
Date:		February 2015
Contact:	Peter Jones <pjones@redhat.com>
Description:	An ordered list of directories, each representing one entry in
		the IEIT, and thus each represents one attempt to verify an
		executable image.

What:		/sys/firmware/efi/ieit/entry$N/action
Date:		February 2015
Contact:	Peter Jones <pjones@redhat.com>
Description:	The result of each execution which was attempted.  This can
		have three values, each separated by a space.
		The first will be one of:
			auth-untested - image was not tested (typically this
					means a BIOS image was booted.)
			sig-failed - image signature verification failed
			sig-passed - image signature verification passed
			sig-missing - image signature not found
			sig-found - image signature found
			policy-failed - configured policy does not allow
				execution
			invalid-0x$X - a value which is not in the standard
				(i.e. "invalid-0x00000008")
		The second value will be one of:
			initialized - the image was started
			uninitialized - the image was not started
		The third value is the raw value of this field, formatted as
		0x-prefixed hex.

What:		/sys/firmware/efi/ieit/entry$N/name
Date:		February 2015
Contact:	Peter Jones <pjones@redhat.com>
Description:	If this entry represents a UEFI device driver, such as an
		option ROM, this is the user-friendly name it registered
		during initialization.  If this is unavailable, it'll be
		an empty string (i.e. just a newline in the file.)

What:		/sys/firmware/efi/ieit/entry$N/device-path
Date:		February 2015
Contact:	Peter Jones <pjones@redhat.com>
Description:	The binary UEFI Device Path for the binary being
		validated, if available.  If this isn't available, the
		value here will be a device path entry with "type"
		"End of Device Path" and a subtype of "End Entire Device
		Path".
